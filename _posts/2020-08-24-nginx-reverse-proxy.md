A reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of web servers and forwards
client request to those web servers. 

Use case:
If we try to access URL http://example.com:8080/api from webpage at http://example.com
due to browser cross domain restrictions we will see CORS errors.

To solve, we can setup Nginx reverse proxy server, so that , we can request URL
http://example.com/api from webpage at http://example.com and the reverse proxy server would
take care of forwarding the request to server running at port 8080.

{% highlight conf %}
server {
    listen       80;
    listen  [::]:80;
    server_name  localhost;

    location / {
        root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index  index.html index.htm;
    }

    location /api {
        proxy_set_header HOST $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

To pass a request to an HTTP proxied server, the `proxy_pass` directive is specified
inside a location.

- `$host` - This variable is set, in order of preference to: the host name from the request line itself,
the "Host" header from the client request, or the server name matching the request.
- `$scheme` - The schema of the original request. 
- `X-Forwarded-Proto` - header gives the proxied server information on the schema of the original request.
- `X-Real-IP` - It is set to the IP address of the client.
- `$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for` - This variable takes the value of original `X-Forwarded-For` header retrieved
from the client and adds the Nginx server IP address to the end.
