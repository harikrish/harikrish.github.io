CSS frameworks provide a basic structure for designing consistent solutions to tackle common recurring
issues across front end web development. They provide generic functionality which can be overridden for 
specific scenarios and applications. This greatly decreases the time needed to start creating applications
and websites. Most of these frameworks contain at least a grid. More functional frameworks also come with
more features and additional JavaScript based functions.

Common features of CSS Frameworks are
- Grid for layout
- Styling for Heading, Lists, Tables, Images etc.
- Media Queries
- Components like Buttons, Input fields, Card, Carousel, Accordian, Nav Bar, Modals etc.
- Utility styles for Padding, Margin, Float etc.

Below is a list of CSS Frameworks,
