Scratch is a visual programming tool which allows the user to create animations 
and games with a drag-and-drop interface. It allows you to create your own computer games, 
interactive stories, and animations using some programming techniques without actually having to write code. 
Itâ€™s a great way to get started programming on the Raspberry Pi with young people. 

The version of Scratch included with the Raspberry Pi has a number of unique features;
one of the most useful is its ability to communicate with the GPIO pins (General Purpose Input Output). 
These pins allow you to connect your Raspberry Pi to a range of devices, from lights and motors to buttons and sensors.
