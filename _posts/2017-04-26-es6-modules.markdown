ES6 is the first time JavaScript has built in modules.

The goal of ES6 modules was to create a format that both users
of CommonJS and of AMD are happy with. Its syntax is even
more compact than CommonJS. Their structure can be statically 
analyzed. Their support of cyclic dependencies is better than CommonJS.
Similar to AMD, they have direct support for asynchronous loading
and configurable module loading.

Use of native JavaScript modules is dependent on the `import` and `export` statements.

{% highlight javascript %}
// file name "sum.js"
function sum(a, b) {
    return a+b;
}

export { sum };

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}
// file name "main.js"
import { sum } from "./sum.js";

let result = sum(1,2);

console.log(result); //3

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
<script type="module" src="main.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

To get modules to work correctly in a browser, you need to make sure that your server is serving them with a `Content-Type` header that contains a `JavaScript` MIME type such as `text/javascript`
