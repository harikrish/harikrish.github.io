A promise is an object that may produce a single value
some time in the future: either a resolved value, or a
reason that it's not resolved. A promise may be in one of
the 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected or pending.
Promise user can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled
value or the reason for rejection.

{% highlight javascript %}

let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  setTimeout(() => resolve("done!"), 1000);
});

// resolve runs the first function in .then
promise.then(
  result => alert(result), // shows "done!" after 1 second
  error => alert(error) // doesn't run
);

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}

let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("Whoops!")), 1000);
});

// reject runs the second function in .then
promise.then(
  result => alert(result), // doesn't run
  error => alert(error) // shows "Error: Whoops!" after 1 second
);

{% endhighlight %}
