A promise is an object that may produce a single value
some time in the future: either a resolved value, or a
reason that it's not resolved. A promise may be in one of
the 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected or pending.
Promise user can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled
value or the reason for rejection.
