The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, 
and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages
 to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python.
It’s capable of doing everything you’d expect a desktop computer to do, 
from browsing the internet and playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets, 
word-processing, and playing games.

The Raspberry Pi operates in the open source ecosystem: it runs Linux (a variety of distributions),
and its main supported operating system, Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian), is open source and runs a suite of open source software.
The Raspberry Pi Foundation contributes to the Linux kernel and various other open source projects as
well as releasing much of its own software as open source.
