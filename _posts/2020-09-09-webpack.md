Webpack is module bundler for modern JavaScript applications.

A module bundler is a tool that takes pieces of JavaScript
and their dependencies and bundles them into a single file,
usually for use in the browser.

### Entry
An entry point indicates which module webpack should use to begin building out its internal dependency graph.

### Output
The output property tells webpack where to emit bundles it creates and how to name these files.

### Loaders
Out of the box, webpack only understands JavaScript and JSON files. Loaders allow webpack to process other file types and convert them into valid modules that can be consumed by your application and added to the dependency graph.

### Plugins
Plugins can be leveraged to perform a wide range of tasks like bundle optimization, asset management and injection of environment variables.
