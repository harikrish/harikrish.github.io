Javascript auto converts any value used in Boolean context (example an `if` condition) 
to either `true` or `false`. This way of implicitly converting a type is 
called as Implicit Type Coercion.

In JavaScript, a truthy value is a value that is considered  `true` when
evaluated in a Boolean context.

A falsy value is a value that translates to `false` when evaluated in a
Boolean context.

The following values are treated as `false`.
- `false`
- `0` (the number zero)
- `""` or `''` (an empty string)
- `null`
- `undefined`
- `NaN` (the result of failed mathematical operations)

All values are truthy unless they are defined as falsy
(i.e., except for `false`, `0`, `""`, `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN`).

The falsy values `null` and `undefined` are not equivalent to anything
except themselves.

The falsy value `NaN` is not equivalent to anything â€” including `NaN`!

Use strict equal (`===`) and strict not equal (`!==`) in situations
where truthy or falsy values could lead to logic errors.

We can  test for several types of invalid data by simply passing a 
variable into an if expression. 
{% highlight javascript %}

if (value) {
  // value is truthy
}
else {
  // value is falsy
  // it could be false, 0, '', null, undefined or NaN
}
{% endhighlight %}
