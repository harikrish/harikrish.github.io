### Power Supply
To connect to a power socket, all Raspberry Pi models have a USB port (the same found on many mobile phones): 
either USB-C for Raspberry Pi 4, or micro USB for Raspberry Pi 3, 2 and 1.

### MicroSD card
Your Raspberry Pi needs an SD card to store all its files and the Raspbian operating system.

### A keyboard and a mouse
To start using your Raspberry Pi, you need a USB keyboard and a USB mouse.

### A TV or computer screen
To view the Raspbian desktop environment, you need a screen, and a cable to link the screen and the Pi.

### HDMI
The Raspberry Pi has a HDMI output port that is compatible with the HDMI port of most modern TVs and computer monitors.
