Lego Mindstroms EV3 is a hardware and software structure produce by Lego for development of 
programmable robots based on Lego building blocks.

The Lego Mindstorms EV3 is the third generation Lego Mindstorms product. 
The set includes motors, sensors, the EV3 programmable brick, 550+ Lego Technic elements and a remote control. 
The EV3 can be controlled by smart-devices.

Main parts of EV3 are listed below,

### EV3 Brick
Programmable, intelligent brick serves as the heart and brain of EV3 robots.
It has input and output ports, button interface, display.
Its powered by AA batteries or EV3 Rechargeable DC battery.
It has ARM 9 processor with Linux-based operating system.

### Large Servo Motor
The EV3 Large Servo Motor is a powerful motor that uses tacho feedback for precise control to 
within one degree of accuracy. 

### Medium Servo Motor
The EV3 Medium Servo Motor is great for lower-load, higher speed applications and when faster response times 
and a smaller profile are needed in the robotâ€™s design.

### Color Sensor
The digital EV3 Color Sensor distinguishes between eight different colors. It also serves as a 
light sensor by detecting light intensities. 

### Touch Sensor
The analog EV3 Touch Sensor is a simple but exceptionally precise tool that detects when its front button is pressed 
or released and is able to count single and multiple presses.

### Infrared Sensor
The digital EV3 Infrared Seeking Sensor detects proximity to the robot and reads signals emitted by the EV3 Infrared Beacon.

### Remote Infrared Beacon
This has been designed for use with the EV3 Infrared Seeker Sensor.
The beacon emits an infrared signal which the sensor can track. The beacon can also be used as a 
remote control for the EV3 brick through signals sent to the infrared sensor.
