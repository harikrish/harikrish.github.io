A transistor is a miniature electronic component that can do two different jobs. It can work either as an amplifier or a switch.

When it works as an amplifier, it takes in a tiny electric current at one end (an input current) and produces a much bigger electric current (an output current) at the other. In other words, it's a kind of current booster.

Transistors can also work as switches. A tiny electric current flowing through one part of a transistor can make a much bigger current flow through another part of it. In other words, the small current switches on the larger one. This is essentially how all computer chips work.

Generally transistor is made of solid material which contains three terminals such as emitter (E), Base (B) and Collector (C) for connections with other components in the circuit. 

There are two main types of transistors-junction transistors and field effect transistors.

### JUNCTION TRANSISTORS
A junction transistor consists of a thin piece of one type of semiconductor material between two thicker layers of the opposite type.
For example, if the middle layer is p-type, the outside layers must be n-type. Such a transistor is an NPN transistor. 
One of the outside layers is called the emitter, and the other is known as the collector. 
The middle layer is the base. The places where the emitter joins the base and the base joins the 
collector are called junctions.

### FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTORS
A field effect transistor has only two layers of semiconductor material, one on top of the other. 
Electricity flows through one of the layers, called the channel. A voltage connected to the other layer, called the gate,
interferes with the current flowing in the channel. Thus, the voltage connected to the gate controls the strength of the 
current in the channel.
