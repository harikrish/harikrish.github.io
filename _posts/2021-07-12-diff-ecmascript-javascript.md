ECMAScript is a language specification and JavaScript is the 
implementation of that specification.

ECMAScript is standardised by Ecma International.

The Ecma TC39 committee is responsible for evolving the 
ECMAScript programming language and authoring the specification.
Changes to the language are developed by way of process.
There are five stages, a strawperson stage, and 4 "maturity" stages.
The TC39 committee must approve accetance for each stage.
