### JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)

so cameras can store more photos on one camera card. Its useful for photographs but not for content like
diagrams or charts which require sharpness.

- File extensions: .jpg .jpeg .jpe .jif .jfif

### GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)

depth than GIF. For photographs not as good as JPEG because of larger file size.
Good for images with text or line art as well.

drawn accurately at any size.
