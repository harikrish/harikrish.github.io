In JavaScript, binding is always explicit, and can be easily lost, so a method using "this" will not refer to the proper object in all situations, Â unless you force it to.
JavaScript provides two options to do explicit binding "apply" and "call".

### Apply
Every JavaScript function is equipped with "apply" method that allows you to call the function with specific binding. I takes two arguments, the binding object and an array of arguments to be passed to the function.
{% highlight javascript %}
fun.apply(thisArg[, argsArray])
{% endhighlight %}

### Call
"Call" method is similar to "apply", but it takes the arguments themselves not an array.
{% highlight javascript %}
fun.call(thisArg[, arg1[, arg2[, ...]]])
{% endhighlight %}
