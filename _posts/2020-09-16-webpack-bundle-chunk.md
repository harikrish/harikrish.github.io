### Bundle
Produced from a number of distinct modules, bundles contain the final
versions of source files that have already undergone the loading and 
compilation process.

### Chunk
Bundles are composed out of chunks. Typically chunks directly correspond
with the output bundles. However, there are some configurations that 
don't yield one-to-one relationship.
